# RateLimiting
 Rate limiting web API with Basic Authentication and Jwt Authorization (Cybercrypt interview project).

* The app registers new users in an in-memory database at the 
 `"POST /random/register"` endpoint, uses HTTP Basic Authentication to verify log-in requests of registered users then generates and assigns JWTs to each user at the `"POST /random/authenticate"` endpoint. 

* The user can then use Bearer Token Authentication to access the `"GET /random"` (or `GET "/random?len=xx"`) endpoint to request a variable length Base64 encoded random string (default length 32). 

* Each user is assigned a byte rate limit and every request by a specific user reduces that user's bytes by the corresponding request's length. Users can have different rate limits and every user's rate is reset every 10 seconds.

* An admin can modify the rate limit for a specified user from the `"POST /random/modify"` endpoint 

* The app uses HSTS headers and HTTPS redirection to supplement Basic Authentication, but a port must be available for the middleware to redirect an insecure request to HTTPS. If no port is available redirection to HTTPS doesn't occur.

## Execution
 This is a C# .Net Core project, it can be built & run instantly by importing it in Visual Studio (Code), or simply using `dotnet run` from the project's root directory.

## Testing
 During development I tested request functionality using Postman, I have included 6 example requests (register, authenticate and random for 2 different users) in a Postman collection file.

## Assumptions
* Using an in memory database to store users, let's assume we don't care about duplicate usernames/passwords. Basic Authentication succeeds as long as the provided credentials are valid.

* No specified authentication method for admin endpoint requests, will use a preset admin user and the endpoint will require Basic Authentication.

* Followed the specifications for the requests' messages and headers as close as I could, but for unspecified stuff I used arbitrary headers and responses.

* No regard for JWT amount per User.

* We don't care about padding of the Base64 encoded random string
